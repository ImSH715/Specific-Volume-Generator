# Specific Volume Generator
## Tech Stack
- CT Lung Image dataset
- SimpleITK
- Python
- Numpy

## Objectives
- The project focuses to find the specific volume value to analyse the difference between status of lungs (asthma, COPD, healthy).
- It directs to the CT Image files
- It finds the specific gas volume based on the quadtree results [link](https://github.com/ImSH715/Quatree-Generator)
- It find the specific gas volume of the CT Images
  - Create Visaulised Charts
    - Heatmap
    - Line map of comparing asthma, COPD and Healthy Lungs
