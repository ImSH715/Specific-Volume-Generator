# Specific Gas Volume Generator
## Tech Stack
- CT Lung Image dataset
- SimpleITK
- Python
- Numpy

## Objectives
- The project focuses to find the specific gas volume value to analyse the difference between status of lungs (asthma, COPD, healthy).
- It directs to the CT Image files
- It finds the specific gas volume based on the quadtree results [link](https://github.com/ImSH715/Quatree-Generator)
- It find the specific gas volume of the CT Images

## Results
- The project generates:
  - Specific gas volume values
  - Diagrams to visualise the results
    - Heatmap
    - Line maps to compare asthma, COPD and Healthy, lungs.
